This example demonstrates a potential issue with error handling in VBScript functions. The `MyFunction` checks for an empty parameter and raises an error if it is. However, if the calling code doesn't include an `On Error Resume Next` or similar error handling mechanism, the script might terminate unexpectedly. This is particularly problematic in situations where errors are not anticipated or where partial success is still required. The solution shows how to properly handle the potential error condition using `On Error Resume Next` and `Err.Number`.
